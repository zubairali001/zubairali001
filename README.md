👋 Hello, 

I'm Zubair Ali, a dynamic developer currently immersed in the world of Unity 3D. Having spent a year honing my skills as a Flutter developer, I've crafted immersive and interactive experiences that resonate with users. Beyond these frameworks, my journey in the tech realm has led me to explore a diverse array of languages, including 👨‍💻 C#, Dart, Java, C, C++, and more.

🌐 Proficient in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, I've ventured into web development, creating seamless and scalable applications. React Native has also been a part of my toolkit for building cross-platform mobile applications, offering a versatile approach to app development.

🚀 Currently studying towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science at COMSATS University Islamabad, I'm committed to bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. My GitHub repositories showcase a blend of personal projects, collaborative endeavors, and experiments that reflect my curiosity and enthusiasm for coding.
